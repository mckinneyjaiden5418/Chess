# Chess Project

**PROJECT STATUS**

✅ Finished – The base game is finished, more features will possibly be added in the future.

**INTRODUCTION**

This is a project for the game of chess! 
The base game is currently finished (basically you can play chess with all the rules working).
I followed a tutorial by OttoBotCode to code the base game (link to channel and tutorial at the bottom of the README).
However, I made a few changes to make this project more personal to me, such as using a different board.

**WHY I FOLLOWED A TUTORIAL**

I followed a tutorial to learn good coding practices.
That was the main reason I did this project in the first place.
I decided that following a tutorial was necessary to achieve my goal because to write good code, you have to know what good code looks like.
