# Chess Project (WIP)

**PROJECT STATUS**

ðŸš§ Unfinished â€“ actively being worked on!

**INTRODUCTION**

This is a project for the game of chess! 
It is currently unfinished, but I am actively working on it and hope to complete it before June.
I am currently following a tutorial by OttoBotCode to code this (link to channel and tutorial at the bottom of the README).
However, I plan on making a few changes to apply my newly learned skills and to make this project more personal to me (such as a different GUI, new rules not originally in chess, and more).


**WHY I FOLLOWED A TUTORIAL**

I didnâ€™t follow a tutorial because I thought I couldnâ€™t make a chess project on my own.
In fact, I think I could make a chess project without a tutorial because I already understand OOP concepts.
The real reason I followed a tutorial is because I want to write cleaner code!
In my last project (a Discord bot Iâ€™m still updating), I eventually realized that as I got deeper into it, my code became pretty unorganized and complicated.
Thus, now that I'm starting my second project, I wanted a big focus to be writing clean code.
But the only way to recognize clean code is to study clean code.
So, even though I dislike following tutorials and like to solve problems on my own or in a team, I decided to follow one to learn how to write code at least a little bit cleaner!

TLDR --> I followed a tutorial to learn how to write clean code because if you don't know what clean code looks like, you likely cannot write clean code.
