PROJECT STATUS

Unfinished, actively being worked on.

INTRODUCTION

This is a project for the game of chess! 
It is currently unfinished, but I am actively working on it and hope to complete it before June.
I am currently following a tutorial by OttoBotCode to code this (link to channel and tutorial at the bottom of the README).
However, I plan on making a few changes to apply my newly learned skills and to make this project more personal to me (such as a different GUI, new rules not originally in chess, and more).


WHY I FOLLOWED A TUTORIAL

I followed a tutorial for this not because I didn't think I could create a chess project on my own.
In fact, I think I could make a chess project without a tutorial because I already understand OOP concepts.
The real reason I followed a tutorial was because I want to write CLEANER code!
My last project (a discord bot which I'm still doing updates on), I eventually realized, as I was getting deeper into it, my code was very unorganized/complicated even though I tried my best to write clean code.
Thus, now that I'm starting my second project, I wanted a big focus to be writing clean code.
However, the only way to know what clean code looks like, is to look at clean code.
So, even though I dislike following tutorials and like to solve problems on my own or in a team, I decided to follow one to learn how to write code at least a little bit cleaner!

TLDR --> I followed a tutorial to learn how to write clean code because if you don't know what clean code looks like, you likely cannot write clean code.
